# Doubling _should_ be easy

Doubling your money in a casino should be easy.

But it's not. Slots will give you 2x your investment 5% of the time, taking you to near ruin 70% of the time.

Table games are slow and grindy -- it's nearly impossible to grind your way to a 2x win.

**What if there was a way to use the casinos own games against the casino to double your money?**
