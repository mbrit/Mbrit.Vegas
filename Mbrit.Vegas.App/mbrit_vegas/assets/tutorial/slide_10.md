# Walking

With variance sorted, we need to look at psychology.

The casino wants us to sit and grind. So we do the **opposite** -- we get up and move.

**We don't play consecutive hands.**

One banker bet on Bacarrat, then one place bet on 6 or 8 on craps, then one hand of Blackjack,
then one hand of Pai Gow.

Ideally, we **walk from one casino to the other**.
