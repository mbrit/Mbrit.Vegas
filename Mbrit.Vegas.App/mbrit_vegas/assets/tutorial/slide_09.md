# More limits

The other limits are that have in the method are we...

**Never invest more than 12 units** (e.g. $300 in $25 chips)

Play **no more than 25 hands**

**Decide to walk** if we see more than 50% profit (our $300 is now $450)

**Definitely walk** if we see more than 100% profit! (Our $300 is now $600)

This binds the session in a small set of outcomes **that we have control over**.
