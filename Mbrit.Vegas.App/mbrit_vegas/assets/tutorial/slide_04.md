# Variance

The most important concept we'll learn today is **variance**. 

The important thing is that **variance overwhlems the house edge**...

...but **only in the first few hands of play**.

By betting bigger, earlier, together with playing a very limited number of hands, you can 
take profit **before the house edge exerts itself**.
