# Risk Management

## The Golden Rules:
1. **Never bet more than you can afford to lose**
2. **Set strict limits before you start**
3. **Walk away when you hit your targets**
4. **Don't let emotions drive decisions**

## Bankroll Protection:
- Use only disposable income
- Never borrow to gamble
- Keep your main bankroll separate
- Track all wins and losses

Remember: This method improves your odds, but gambling always involves risk.
