# Bet structure

If we play that accumulated $100 and we win -- **we bank that as profit, never
touch it again in the session**.

This is a streak of THREE wins -- not unusual.

We keep the $100 there and try again. A streak of FOUR wins -- still not unusual --
sees us make $200 profit from a $25 investment.

If we lose at any point in the sequence, we start again.

This is how we **draw money out from the casino**.
