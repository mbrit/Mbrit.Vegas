# Leverage

By making **small accumulation bets**, we can snipe wins from "**short-tail variance**" early game.

Place $25 and see if it wins.

If it wins, add the $25 you won to the bet and play $50.

If it wins, add the $50 you won to the bet and play $100.

Now you've leveraged your $25 investment into $100.

Variance tells us **this happens often** in any play session. And it's our best chance to get ahead.
