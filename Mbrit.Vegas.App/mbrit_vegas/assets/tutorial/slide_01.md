# Why do casinos always win?

People **lose money** in casinos because...

They **grind** for 40-50 minutes where the house edge makes them bleed every hand

They don't set **stop loss limits** and **take profit** points

They **give back all the money they made** to the casino

_The third is the most dangerous_. How many times have you been up and thought "one more hand" 
and left the casino at breakeven or down?
