People lose money in casinos because...

1) They grind for 40-50 minutes games where the house edge makes them bleed every hand

2) They don't set stop loss limits and take profit points

3) They give the casino back all the money they made

The 3rd one is the worse one. How many times have you been up and thought "one more hand" 
and left the casino at breakeven or down?
