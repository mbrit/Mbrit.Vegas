# What are we _actually_ doing

We are creating **a mini-game of our own using the components the casinos give us**.

So now they're playing _our_ game, we're not playing _theirs_.

Short sessions with larger bets in short accumulator bursts lets us **take advantage of variance before the house edge overwhelms us**.

Physical movement and chopping and changing games lets us **choose our own psychology**.
