# Streaks

Variance is how we get streaks of wins or losses. 

As humans, we tend to think of streaks as very unlikely. 

But if you toss a coin 10 times, you'll see four heads or four tails **often**.

**Streaks are much more likely than we think they are**.

We know this happens in gambling -- we've seen the Blackjack dealer hit 20-21 against our 18-19 three times
in a row plenty of times.
