# How the app works

You create a session, and it **guides you through what you need to do on each step**.

And it keeps **track of your profit** so you're very clear on when to walk.

(And how much you walk with.)

It also **keeps track of where are you are**.

So if you want to play a few hands, go see a show or get dinner... 
you come back to the app when you want and continue.
