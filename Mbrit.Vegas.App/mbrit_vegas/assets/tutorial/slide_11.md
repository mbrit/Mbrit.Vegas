# Walking, really?

Yes. Really.

Because walking **creates evaluation points** where we choose what we're doing. We don't tilt into
"I'm due" or "just one more hand". 

But most important, Vegas has, for 60 years, got **devastatingly good** at making us sit there
and play. 

And we **can't win if we sit in one place and play how they want us to**.
