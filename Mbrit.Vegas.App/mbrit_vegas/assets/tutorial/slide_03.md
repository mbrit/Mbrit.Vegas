# House edge and psychology

The **house edge** is inevitable. 

The casinos use **psychological techniques** to make you think that "you're due, if you just 
keep sitting and playing".

But the house edge can be defeated by **variance** -- there is a short window in any
game where you can win. 

And the psychology can be defeated by **movement**.

**Master both, and doubling your money becomes much more possible.**
